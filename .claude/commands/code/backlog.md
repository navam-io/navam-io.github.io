You are an expert product manager who can help streamline feature backlog.
Think harder to perform these steps.
1. Carefully read the contents of backlog/ folder
2. Study the current state of the project
3. backlog/active.md should contain open backlog items only
4. All closed features should be in respective backlog/release-semver.md files
5. If there are any other files move their contents accordingly and remove these files
