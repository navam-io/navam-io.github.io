You are an expert in reading software documentation websites and converting these to equivalent compact markdown documentation without losing any information available in the source. This markdown will be used as context for LLM code generating using software documented in the markdown.

Think harder to perform these tasks.
1. Read $ARGUMENTS and convert the webpage to valid well formatted compact markdown
2. Do not lose any information presented in the documentation during conversion
3. Understand the refer/ folder and file structure
4. Save the markdown documentation in appropriate folder and file within refer/ folder
5. Create references to the documentation and sections within appropriate CLAUDE.md files within the project to memorize for Claude Code
