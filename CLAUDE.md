# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the **navam.io** static website repository, intended for GitHub Pages deployment. The site serves as the marketing landing page and blog for Navam, a product studio exploring frontier interfaces for AI‚ÜîAI, AI‚ÜîHuman, and AI‚ÜîWorld interactions.

The flagship product is **Navam Invest** - an AI-powered investment intelligence tool for retail investors with a Text User Interface (TUI).

## Development Workflow

### Custom Slash Commands

This project uses custom Claude Code commands for streamlined development:

1. **`/code/develop`** - Primary development workflow:
   - Reads `backlog/active.md` to understand next feature
   - Implements the feature
   - Marks complete and moves to appropriate `backlog/release-semver.md`

2. **`/code/refer [URL]`** - Documentation ingestion:
   - Browses external documentation websites
   - Converts to compact markdown without losing information
   - Saves to appropriate `refer/` subfolder
   - Updates CLAUDE.md with references

3. **`/code/backlog`** - Backlog cleanup:
   - Ensures `backlog/active.md` contains only open items
   - Moves closed features to `backlog/release-semver.md` files
   - Removes unnecessary backlog files

4. **`/code/commit`** - Standard git commit workflow

### Website Development Guidelines

**Design System Requirements (Apple-inspired, Bold, Professional):**
- Use **dark, vivid gradients** (600-900 range): `from-pink-900 to-purple-900`, `from-blue-600 to-indigo-600`
- Implement **glass morphism**: `backdrop-blur-xl` with transparency (`bg-white/10`)
- Apply **strong contrast**: Dark backgrounds, white text, bold CTAs
- Use **epic typography**: `font-black` for headings, tight letter-spacing
- Add **scale & shadow animations**: `hover:scale-105`, `shadow-2xl`, colored glows
- Reference existing components: `Card.vue`, `Hero.vue`, `Button.vue` for patterns
- **NOT pastel** - Bold, saturated, professional aesthetic

**Content Sources:**
- Product specs: `refer/specs/brief.md`
- Visual references: `refer/images/navam-invest/*.png` (7 UI screenshots)
- External product info: https://github.com/navam-io/navam-invest
- Installation command: `pip install navam-invest`

**Site Structure:**
- Marketing landing page (homepage)
- Blog section with posts about Navam Invest

## Local Development

**IMPORTANT: DO NOT spawn dev server automatically.**

The user manages their own build and preview process in a separate terminal. Only start the dev server if:
1. You need it for your own testing, OR
2. The user explicitly asks you to start it

### Astro Development Skill

**Skill location:** `.claude/skills/astro/`

This project has a dedicated **Astro Development Skill** that automatically provides:
- Project-specific Astro patterns with design system enforcement
- Progressive disclosure from `refer/astro-docs/` (244KB comprehensive documentation)
- Curated guidance for Vue 3 integration, content collections, routing, and styling
- Build configuration and deployment patterns

The skill triggers automatically when working on Astro code and loads relevant documentation based on your specific task. It enforces:
- **Pastel gradient** design system
- **Vue client directives** for proper hydration
- **Type-safe content collections** for blog posts
- **Static site generation** optimized for GitHub Pages

**Direct documentation access** (when needed outside skill context):
- Complete docs: `refer/astro-docs/`
- Documentation map: `refer/astro-docs/README.md`

### Astro Development Server

This project uses **Astro 5.14.5** with Vue 3 components. To run the development server (only when needed):

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts the Astro dev server on `http://localhost:4321/` with:
- Hot module replacement (HMR)
- Vue component hydration
- Content collections validation
- Tailwind CSS processing
- Fast refresh on file changes

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates optimized static files in `dist/` directory.

## Key Architecture Decisions

This is an **Astro static site** with the following stack:
- **Framework**: Astro 5.14.5 (Static Site Generator)
- **UI Components**: Vue 3 with client-side hydration
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + custom CSS properties
- **Content**: Astro content collections for type-safe blog management
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages (automated via GitHub Actions)

## Git Workflow & GitHub Pages Deployment

### üö® CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT POLICY üö®

**DO NOT PUSH TO `main` BRANCH UNLESS EXPLICITLY INSTRUCTED BY USER.**

**Mandatory Workflow:**
1. Make code changes and commit locally
2. Build the site: `npm run build`
3. Preview locally (user will do this in separate terminal)
4. **WAIT for user to confirm "publish ready"**
5. Only then push to `main` to trigger deployment

**Reasoning:**
- Pushing to `main` immediately triggers GitHub Pages deployment
- User must verify changes locally before publishing to production
- Prevents publishing broken or unwanted changes to live site

### Standard Workflow for Local Development

**Step 1: Commit Changes Locally**
```bash
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message (but DO NOT push yet!)
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

**Step 2: Build and Test Locally**
```bash
# Build the site
npm run build

# User will preview in separate terminal
# DO NOT spawn dev server automatically
```

**Step 3: Wait for User Approval**
- User will test the built site locally
- User will explicitly instruct: "publish" or "deploy" when ready

**Step 4: Deploy to Production (ONLY when instructed)**
```bash
# Only run this when user says "publish" or "deploy"
git push origin main
```

### GitHub Actions Deployment

- **Trigger:** Push to `main` branch
- **Workflow:** Deploy to GitHub Pages (automated)
- **Duration:** Typically 2-5 minutes
- **Monitor:** https://github.com/navam-io/navam-io.github.io/actions

### Branch Structure

- `main`: Production deployment branch (protected - only push when instructed)
- `master`: Not currently used (repository is on `main` branch)

### Important Reminders

- ‚úÖ **DO**: Build locally, commit locally, test locally
- ‚úÖ **DO**: Wait for explicit user instruction before deploying
- ‚ùå **DO NOT**: Push to `main` automatically after committing
- ‚ùå **DO NOT**: Deploy without user confirmation
- ‚ùå **DO NOT**: Assume changes are ready to publish

The repository has permissions preconfigured for: add, commit, push, checkout, log, reset, pull, rebase, merge, remote operations.
