## Image Placement Strategy

### "Introducing Navam Invest" Post
**Status:** Complete âœ“
**Images:** All 7 screenshots appropriately placed
**Strategy:** Comprehensive product showcase - each image illustrates a specific feature section

1. starting.png â†’ Welcome/Getting Started section
2. natural-prompt.png â†’ Natural language interface demonstration
3. response.png â†’ AI agent response example
4. report.png â†’ Investment report output
5. api.png â†’ Privacy/API configuration section
6. help.png â†’ Command reference section
7. examples.png â†’ Example queries section

**Rationale:** As the flagship product launch post, it makes sense to showcase all product capabilities with corresponding screenshots. This provides a complete visual tour of the application.

### "Vibe Coding with AI" Post
**Status:** Complete âœ“
**Images:** No product screenshots
**Strategy:** Development-focused narrative doesn't require UI screenshots

**Rationale:** This post focuses on the development philosophy and journey. The content is about *building* the product, not using it. Product screenshots would distract from the conceptual narrative.

### "Building Multi-Agent Architecture" Post
**Status:** Complete âœ“
**Images:** No product screenshots
**Strategy:** Architecture-focused technical content doesn't require UI screenshots

**Rationale:** This deep-dive architectural post focuses on LangGraph patterns, agent design, and technical implementation. Code examples and conceptual explanations are more appropriate than UI screenshots.
