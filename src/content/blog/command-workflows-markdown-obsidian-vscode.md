## Transform Partial Ideas into Complete Content

One of Command's most powerful features is its ability to expand partial content into complete, well-researched material. Write partial blog posts, seed ideas, intent lists, or incomplete notesâ€”then use Command to expand them into finished content.

This workflow transforms how knowledge workers create content, turning hours of writing into minutes while maintaining quality and consistency.

## The `refer` Command: Your Content Expansion Engine

The `refer` command works with custom `refer-section` configs in `command.yml` to transform partial content into complete posts, notes, articles, or research papers. You can:

- Experiment with different models
- Tune settings by document type
- Define custom folders for organization
- Specify document-specific system prompts

### Example: Expanding Blog Posts

Let's say you have a partially written blog post on startup growth strategies in your `Posts` folder. Here's the related config section using Claude Opus 4.1 for creative writing:

```yaml
refer-post-to-update:
  lookup-folder: Posts
  max-tokens: 4000
  model: opus4-1          # Optimized: Opus 4.1 excels at creative writing
  provider: claude
  save: true
  save-folder: Posts
  system: You will be given a partially written blog post on a topic.
    Your job as an expert blog writer is to expand the post
    with well-researched content, engaging examples, and actionable insights.
    Maintain the author's voice and style while adding depth and polish.
  temperature: 0.5
```

Run the command and watch as the model streams its response:

```bash
refer post-to-update "startup-growth-hacking"
```

The expanded post saves to the `Posts` folder with an `updated` prefix, preserving your original.

## Create Custom Document Types

Want to process research papers, class notes, or cooking recipes? Just copy and customize a `refer-*` section:

### Research Paper Summaries

```yaml
refer-paper-to-summarize:
  lookup-folder: Papers
  max-tokens: 2000
  model: sonnet4-5      # Sonnet 4.5 for technical analysis
  provider: claude
  save: true
  save-folder: Summaries
  system: Summarize this research paper, focusing on methodology,
    key findings, and implications. Include citations and limitations.
  temperature: 0.3
```

### Meeting Notes Expansion

```yaml
refer-notes-to-expand:
  lookup-folder: Notes
  max-tokens: 4000
  model: haiku4-5      # Haiku 4.5 is fast and cost-effective
  provider: claude
  save: true
  save-folder: Notes/Expanded
  system: Transform these raw meeting notes into a structured document
    with clear action items, decisions made, and follow-up tasks.
  temperature: 0.3
```

Then run your custom command:
```bash
refer notes-to-expand "weekly-standup-2025-10-15"
```

## Model Selection Best Practices

Different content types benefit from different models:

- **Haiku 4.5**: Simple extraction, templates, summaries (fast, 40% cheaper)
- **Sonnet 4.5**: Complex analysis, technical writing, code generation
- **Opus 4.1**: Creative writing, deep research synthesis, content expansion

## Combining Commands for Powerful Workflows

Command becomes even more powerful when you combine multiple commands. Here's a complete workflow for generating comprehensive content:

### Step 1: Define Your Document Template

Create a markdown template for a set of intents. For example, `Financial Analysis.md` or `Product Management.md`. Add a few intents as headings:

```markdown
# Financial Analysis

## Macro Factors Impact Stocks
[Prompts to analyze macro economic factors]

## Top Companies by ROCE
[Prompts to identify high-return companies]

## Tech Sector Valuation
[Prompts to analyze tech valuations]
```

### Step 2: Expand Intents

Use Command to brainstorm more related intents and prompts:

```bash
refer intents-to-expand "Financial Analysis"
```

The model will add more relevant intents and prompts to your template.

### Step 3: Generate Content Embeds

Now run the intents command and choose which intents to generate:

```bash
cmnd intents "Financial Analysis"
```

You'll see a list of intents. Choose the ones you want to expand, and Command will:
1. Generate content for each selected intent
2. Save responses under the `Embeds` folder automatically
3. Link embeds in your document template instantly

### Step 4: Visualize in Obsidian

If you're using Obsidian, the Graph view shows all your linked embeds, creating a beautiful knowledge network. You can:
- Link related templates
- Enhance generated embeds with more intents
- Use Obsidian plugins to generate websites, PDFs, and more

Your creativity + Obsidian + Command = Magic!

## Obsidian Integration

Command's markdown-first approach makes it perfect for Obsidian users. Here's how to set it up:

### 1. Initialize Command in Your Vault

```bash
cd /path/to/your/obsidian/vault
cmnd init
```

This creates:
- `command.yml` configuration file
- Sample `Intents` and `Embeds` folders
- `.env.local.example` for API keys

### 2. Configure Your Workflow

Edit `command.yml` to match your Obsidian structure:

```yaml
ask:
  provider: claude
  model: sonnet4-5
  save: true
  save-folder: Notes/Quick

refer-note-to-expand:
  lookup-folder: Notes/Drafts
  save-folder: Notes/Complete
  model: opus4-1

intents:
  lookup-folder: Templates
  save-folder: Embeds
  model: sonnet4-5
```

### 3. Create Templates

Use Obsidian's template system alongside Command intents:

```markdown
# {{title}}
Date: {{date}}
Tags: #draft #ai-generated

## Overview
[Brief description]

## Key Points
- Point 1
- Point 2

## Analysis
[To be expanded by Command]
```

### 4. Expand and Link

Run Command to expand sections, then use Obsidian's linking features:

```bash
refer note-to-expand "market-analysis-draft"
```

The expanded note appears in your vault, ready for linking with `[[wiki-links]]`.

## VS Code Integration

Command works beautifully with VS Code for code-centric workflows:

### 1. Project Setup

Initialize Command in your project root:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/vscode/project
cmnd init
```

### 2. Code Documentation Workflow

Create a `refer-code-to-document` section in `command.yml`:

```yaml
refer-code-to-document:
  lookup-folder: src
  save-folder: docs
  model: sonnet4-5
  system: You are analyzing source code files.
    Generate comprehensive documentation including purpose,
    architecture, key functions, and usage examples.
  temperature: 0.3
```

### 3. Generate Documentation

```bash
refer code-to-document "api-handlers.py"
```

Command analyzes your code and generates detailed documentation in markdown format.

### 4. Test Case Generation

```yaml
refer-code-to-test:
  lookup-folder: src
  save-folder: tests
  model: sonnet4-5
  system: Generate comprehensive test cases for this code,
    including edge cases, error handling, and integration tests.
  temperature: 0.2
```

```bash
refer code-to-test "user-service.py"
```

## Advanced Workflow: Content Validation

Verify content generated by one LLM with validation from another model:

```yaml
validate:
  provider: claude
  model: opus4-1          # Use Opus 4.1 for deep validation
  max-tokens: 4000
  temperature: 0.0        # Deterministic for validation
  system: Validate the following content for accuracy,
    completeness, and coherence. Suggest improvements.
```

After generating embeds with `cmnd intents`, validate them:

```bash
cmnd validate "Financial Analysis"
```

The diff is calculated on original and validated text, removing newlines, whitespace, and markdown formatting for similarity scoring. Use this to automate quality validation of generated content.

## Practical Use Cases

### Blog Writing Workflow

1. Write brief outline in `Posts/drafts/`
2. Expand with `refer post-to-update "outline"`
3. Validate with `cmnd validate`
4. Review and publish

**Time saved:** 70% reduction in writing time while maintaining quality.

### Research Workflow

1. Collect sources in `Research/sources/`
2. Summarize with `refer paper-to-summarize`
3. Generate synthesis with `cmnd intents "Research Project"`
4. Create visualizations in Obsidian

**Result:** Comprehensive research synthesis in hours instead of days.

### Documentation Workflow

1. Write code with inline comments
2. Generate docs with `refer code-to-document`
3. Create API documentation with `cmnd intents "API Docs"`
4. Validate technical accuracy with different model

**Outcome:** Always up-to-date, comprehensive documentation.

## Privacy-First Workflows

For sensitive content, use local models:

```yaml
refer-confidential-note:
  lookup-folder: Private
  save-folder: Private/Expanded
  model: llama          # Local Llama 3.1 via Ollama
  provider: ollama      # Fully local, zero cloud
  system: Process this confidential information...
```

Your sensitive data never leaves your machine.

## Run Multiple Models Side by Side

Compare different models' output by running them in parallel terminal windows:

**Terminal 1 (Opus 4.1 - Creative):**
```bash
cmnd config refer-post model opus4-1
refer post-to-update "content-strategy"
```

**Terminal 2 (Sonnet 4.5 - Analytical):**
```bash
cmnd config refer-post model sonnet4-5
refer post-to-update "content-strategy"
```

**Terminal 3 (Local Llama - Fast Draft):**
```bash
cmnd config refer-post model llama
cmnd config refer-post provider ollama
refer post-to-update "content-strategy"
```

Compare outputs and choose the best result or combine insights from multiple models.

## Audit Your Workflow

Track your content generation over time:

```bash
cmnd audit
```

The audit dashboard shows:
- Most used templates and intents
- Model performance by content type
- Token usage and cost analysis
- Saved files and their locations

Use these insights to optimize your workflow and reduce costs.
