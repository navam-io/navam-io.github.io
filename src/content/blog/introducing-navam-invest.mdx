## The Problem with Traditional Wealth Management

Retail investors managing portfolios between $50K and $1M face a dilemma. Professional wealth management services charge $1,000-$10,000 per year, putting comprehensive investment research out of reach for most individual investors. At the same time, making informed investment decisions requires analyzing earnings reports, understanding macroeconomic trends, evaluating risk exposures, and optimizing tax strategies.

We built Navam Invest to solve this problem.

## What is Navam Invest?

Navam Invest is an AI-powered investment intelligence tool that runs entirely on your laptop. It combines 10 specialized AI agents to provide professional-grade investment analysis for a fraction of traditional costs—typically $3-15 per month in API usage.

### Ask Questions in Plain English

No need to learn complex interfaces or query languages. Just ask your investment questions naturally:

- "What are the key risks in my tech-heavy portfolio?"
- "Should I buy Apple or Microsoft right now?"
- "Show me undervalued growth stocks in the healthcare sector"
- "Help me optimize my portfolio for tax-loss harvesting"

Navam Invest automatically routes your question to the appropriate AI agents and orchestrates multi-agent workflows when needed.

## 10 Specialized AI Agents

Each agent is an expert in a specific domain of investment analysis:

## Transparent & Explainable AI

Every recommendation comes with clear reasoning. You'll understand exactly why the AI suggests each investment decision, what data it analyzed, and what assumptions it made. No black boxes.
