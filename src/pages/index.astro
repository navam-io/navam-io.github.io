Every feature includes documentation, tests, and prompts used to generate the code. You're getting reference implementations that work first time, not experimental code."

The architecture is modular, well-documented, and built specifically for AI-assisted customization. BSL-1.1 license means you can use it commercially without restrictions."

          "text": "Vibe coding is a development philosophy where humans focus on strategic direction while AI handles implementation. You describe the desired outcome and provide domain expertise, then AI generates and modifies the code. Navam products were built using vibe coding and are optimized for you to continue developing this way."

For customizing the code: basic familiarity with Python and terminal commands helps. The products include AI-friendly documentation that helps AI assistants guide you through customization even if you're not an expert developer."
